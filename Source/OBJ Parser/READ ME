OBJ PARSER

should parse an OBJ File into an .h file

Please make OBJ models in blender in the same way as this tutorial specifies:
http://www.raywenderlich.com/48293/how-to-export-blender-models-to-opengl-es-part-1

Updated to take user input for OBJ filename.

IMPORTANT:
Before running, please go to Product->Scheme->Edit Scheme
then select the Options tab. Under options check “use custom working directory” and enter in ${PROJECT_DIR}

now you should be good to go.

USAGE:
1.Place the OBJ File into the "Source" folder
2.Open the OBJ Parser project
3.Run the program and enter the OBJ file name (without extension) into the debug window
when prompted
4.Run the program (hope it doesn't die)
5.Check the product folder; a .h file with the same name as the model should be produced.

That's it. Should work.
